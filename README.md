# G'day

People call me Carter.

I've been building Products for a while now at great places like Linktree, The Lumery, TRENDii and Insuretech, and now i'm focussing on building piing.ai from the ground up.

I'm experienced most disciplines like Product, Data Eng/Sci, MLOps, SRE, Growth, and Web/Mobile Engineering, which is all just a means to an end for bringing products to market.
