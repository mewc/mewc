# G'day

I've been building Products for a while now, such as Linktree, TRENDii, bagstashhh, teraflect, piing.ai, and Insuretech. As well as commercial & marketing centered roles for various ecomm & martech companies, agencies & products - bigger ones include The Lumery, Jetstar. I'm currently working on getting my own products into ramen-profitability and picking up exciting projects for companies here and there.

I'm experienced most disciplines like Product, Saas / Software Eng, Data Platforms (eng/sci/ops), MLOps, SRE, Growth, and Web/Mobile Engineering, which is all just a means to an end for bringing products to market. Some more buzzwords include Event Driven Systems, O11y, localfirst sync engines, real time data analytics, integrating ai (eg. chat gpt/claude) for real product uses.
