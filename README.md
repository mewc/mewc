# G'day

I've been building Products for a while now, such as Linktree, TRENDii, bagstashhh, teraflect, piing.ai, and Insuretech. As well as commercial & marketing centered roles for various ecomm & martech companies, agencies & products - bigger ones include The Lumery, Jetstar. I'm currently working on getting my own products into ramen-profitability and picking up exciting projects for companies here and there.

I'm experienced most disciplines like Product, Saas / Software Eng, Data Platforms (eng/sci/ops), MLOps, SRE, Growth, and Web/Mobile Engineering, which is all just a means to an end for bringing products to market. I've recently started getting into IoT devices (lorawan, rok, chirpstack/things network) and activating the data ingested into real products.

Some more buzzwords that might encapsulate things i've built, integrated or leveraged in my products include Event Driven Systems, Product Analytics (Experimentation, ABtesting, statsig), integrations marketplaces, O11y, localfirst sync engines, real time data analytics, integrating ai (eg. chat gpt/claude) for real product uses.
